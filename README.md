He logs onto a ShwopApp marketplace and finds the washing machine. What is even better is that there is a special offer price and it can be delivered to his home.
This is where ShwopApp comes to the rescue for many shoppers. They go online, search for an item, get a fast response and can buy it just as quickly.

adding to cart – all steps happen in no time at all. In the end, the buyer is happy because he has the item and didn’t have to travel far.

One of the biggest advantages of ShwopApp is that keep sellers interested in online selling is cost reduction. Many sellers have to pay lots to maintain their physical store. 
They may need to pay extra up front costs like rent, repairs, store design, inventory etc. In many cases, even after investing in services, stock, maintenance and workforce,
sellers don’t receive desired profits and ROI.
How this is different with ShwopApp? - With an ecommerce store, a seller can reduce how much is spent in store upkeep. An ecommerce store is affordable
and requires less investment when compared with a physical store.
This is also a good opportunity for individual and small scale sellers who want to earn an income but don’t have the required start-up capital.
